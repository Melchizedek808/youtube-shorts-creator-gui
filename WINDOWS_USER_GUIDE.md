### "Where does my video save?"
Wherever you chose in Step 4! By default, it saves to your Desktop.

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

### 1. Good Audio = Good Captions
If using Auto captions:
- Speak clearly in your reaction video
- Reduce background noise
- Don't play loud music while talking

### 2. Video Length
- Keep videos under 60 seconds for best YouTube Shorts results
- Shorter videos process faster!

### 3. File Location
- Save videos to your Desktop or Documents folder
- Don't save to C:\Program Files (may cause permission issues)

### 4. Music Volume
- Don't worry! The app automatically makes music quieter (30%)
- Your voice will always be louder than the music

## üò± Something Went Wrong?

### App Won't Start

2. Right-click the .exe ‚Üí **Run as Administrator**
3. If Windows blocks it: Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Check "Unblock" ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí OK

### Error During Processing
1. Make sure all 3 files are selected (original, reaction, music)
2. Try saving to your Desktop instead

4. Check you have at least 5GB of free space on your computer

### "Cannot Find File" Error
- Make sure you didn't move or delete the video files after selecting them
- Don't select videos from USB drives that get disconnected

### Captions Not Working
